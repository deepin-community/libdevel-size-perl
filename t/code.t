# For me, for some files locally, I'm seeing failures
# Failed test '&two_lex is bigger than an empty sub by less than 2048 bytes'
# Just for some perl versions (5.8.7, 5.10.1, some 5.12.*)
# As ever, the reason is subtle and annoying. As this test is running in package
# main, loading modules at runtime might create entries in %::
# In this case, it's just one key, '_</.../lib/perl5/5.12.4/overload.pm'
# because Test::More is demand loading overload at the first test.
# So the first fix I tried was to "encourage" Test::More to get all this done
# before we start doing things that are sensitive to the size of %::
# with this:
#
# cmp_ok(1, '==', 1, "prompt Test::More to load everything it needs *now*");
#
# which fixed most things, but not 5.8.7, which (*only under make test*) would
# fail '&two_lex is bigger than an empty sub by less than 2048 bytes'
# Turns out that Test::More 0.54 creates an entry in %:: for every test run
# (not sure why, side effect of an eval with a #line directive, maybe?)
# The solution is to measure (and re-measure) the size of things you're
# comparing as contiguous statements, assigning to variables, and then make
# calls to Test::More functions.
